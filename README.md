Our research provides a comprehensive analysis of the bionomics and control strategies for *Anopheles stephensi*, a mosquito species that has recently been detected in eight African countries, posing a significant threat to global malaria control efforts. Through a systematic literature review of 83 articles from both its native and invasive ranges, we found that host-seeking animal baited traps are more effective in the native range, and that the mosquito's breeding habitat preferences shift in invasive regions. Moreover, our analysis indicates that temephos, fenthion, *Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis*, and *Beauveria bassiana* are more effective in the native range. Given these findings, it is imperative that further research is conducted in invasive regions in order to develop and implement effective strategies for malaria control.
